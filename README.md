#PhotoTagger

An app mimicking Facebook's phototagging function. Built in the MVCish style of Backbone.js without any Backbone. Features: 
 * Users upload urls to photos
 * Photos have detail, index, and edit views
 * To tag, jQuery is used to determine the location of the click, a red box is drawn around the area and a list of taggable users is rendered
